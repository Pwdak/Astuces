To push your Docker image to Docker Hub, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Login to Docker Hub**: Before you can push images to Docker Hub, you need to log in with your Docker Hub account. Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

   You'll be prompted to enter your Docker Hub username and password. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, follow the prompts to complete the login.

2. **Tag your Docker Image**: Ensure that your Docker image is properly tagged with your Docker Hub username and the desired repository name. You can use the `docker tag` command to do this. Replace `your-username` with your Docker Hub username, and `your-repo-name` with the name of your repository on Docker Hub:

   ```bash
   docker tag your-image-name:your-tag your-username/your-repo-name:your-tag
   ```

   Make sure you've previously built your Docker image with the desired name and tag.

3. **Push the Image to Docker Hub**: Once your image is properly tagged, you can push it to Docker Hub using the `docker push` command:

   ```bash
   docker push your-username/your-repo-name:your-tag
   ```

   Docker will start uploading your image to Docker Hub. The time it takes depends on the size of your image and your internet connection speed.

4. **Verify the Upload**: After the upload is complete, you can verify that your image is available on Docker Hub by visiting your Docker Hub repository URL in a web browser or by searching for it on the Docker Hub website.

Now, your Docker image is publicly available on Docker Hub for others to use.

Remember to keep your Docker Hub credentials secure and avoid sharing them publicly. Additionally, if you want to share private Docker images, you may need to set up a private repository on Docker Hub or consider using other container registry services that offer more control over access and permissions.
